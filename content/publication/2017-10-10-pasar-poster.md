abstract = "Advances in sequencing techniques have massively increased the publicly accessible -omics data and thus enable further and more extensive research opportunities on genome diversity. The concept of the pangenome refers to the union of gene families shared by a set of genomes. Several studies have implemented specific pangenome analyses for a variety of organisms, ranging from microbes to viruses and plants , leading to genomic projects of various scales and the advancement of general understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, generating usable knowledge across multiple sectors."
