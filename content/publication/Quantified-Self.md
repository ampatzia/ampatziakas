abstract = "Seniors  tend  to  self-track  their  health  in  various 
ways in their daily life. In fact self-tracking has become a habit of 
their  daily  lives  and  a  way  of  living.  Therefore,  Quantified
Self offers  a  great  match  for  this  age  group  in  particular.  Towards 
this  direction  we  have  been  developing  a  web  application  which 
visualizes sensor data gathered in real life settings for over a six
months' period.    Technological    details of the  application 
developed   are   provided   along   with   the   type   of   visualized 
information.  Further  work  is  planned  towards  a  user-friendly 
interface   and  the  pilot  testing  of  the  application  within  the 
network of established living environments."
