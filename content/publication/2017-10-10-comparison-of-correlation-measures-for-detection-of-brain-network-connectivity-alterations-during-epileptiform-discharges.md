abstract = "The research on epileptiform discharges (ED) in electroencephalographic recordings of patients with epilepsy has shown that changes are observed in connectivity of the brain area correlation networks. The data processed describe various epileptiform discharge situations. In some cases, the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive stimulation technique applicable in the field of focal epilepsy treatment, is used. In the current study, we examine the connectivity change of networks, formed by analyzing the correlation of selected EEG channels using cross correlation and cross mutual information networks."
